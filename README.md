# HEPL package

This package allows changing the selected word by a combination of HEPL…

This is a little package created for the course of RIA at La Province de Liège Higher Education Institution (hence the name HEPL).

## How does it work?
> When you select a word, such as ‘school’ for example and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> (such as h-epl), you have another word so here : ‘HeplHe’.
